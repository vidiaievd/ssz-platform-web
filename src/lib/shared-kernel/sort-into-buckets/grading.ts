// Grading for `sort_into_buckets`: the whole board at once, and what a check leaves behind.
//
// One `Sjekk` sends every placement (DECISIONS §5). Its result decides, at the same time,
// the score, which items lock, whether the board is closed, and how much of the key the
// student may see. It runs on the server over the server's document — the client supplies
// placements and nothing else; the key, the settings and which items are even shown come
// from `ex`.
//
// ── The score is the first check ────────────────────────────────────────────
// What the engine records is **first-check accuracy over all ready items**: an item the
// student did not place on the first check counts as wrong, not as an abstention
// (SPEC_api_contract §Grading — the defence against dumping everything into the largest
// bucket; plan 66 Q5-A). Later checks change what the student sees — which tiles lock,
// which explanations appear — and never the score. The server carries the first placement
// of every item forward from check to check (`firstBuckets`), the way plan 54 carries
// `firstAnswer`, so the number survives re-checks that overwrite the attempt's details.
//
// ── How much of the key a check returns ─────────────────────────────────────
//   * whether each placed item is right — on every check, it is the point of checking;
//   * for a wrong item, the explanation for *that* bucket: `fb.ov[chosen] ?? fb.def`;
//   * the primary bucket, each item's `why` and each bucket's rule — only once the board is
//     closed (all right, revealed, or out of checks) **and** `revealKey` is on. Sending the
//     answer beside a wrong tile that still has a retry left would make the retry theatre.
