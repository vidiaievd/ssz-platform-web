// Model for the `sort_into_buckets` exercise.

//
// N items into 2-5 labelled buckets — "classify", where `match_pairs` is "find the partner".
// Two ideas from the handoff shape everything here:
//
//   1. **An item is written once and clicked into its bucket.** `item.bucketId` *is* the
//      key; there is no second list kept in step with the first. It lives on the key side
//      of the storage split (persistence.ts) and never reaches the browser.
//   2. **A wrong bucket is a teachable moment.** Every ready item owes a default
//      explanation (`fb[itemId].def`, a blocker); a text per (item × wrong bucket) is
//      coverage the author fills in over time (`fb[itemId].ov[bucketId]`).
//
// Field names are camelCase (plan 34 §7). The author's focus (grammar / vocabulary) is
// *not* a field: decision Q1-A of plan 66 — the subject is derived from the atom graph or
// set in the shared axes card, never authored into the document.
