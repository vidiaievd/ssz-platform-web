// Everything wrong with the audio on an exercise — plan 56 §4, from README.md
// ("Validation").
//
// The rule this file exists to keep is the same one the nine per-type kernels keep, and
// INTEGRATION.md restates it for the audio layer: **one `audioIssues`.** The step rail,
// the inline message on a card, the pre-assign gate and the server's publish preflight
// are four filters over this one list. A type with an audio rule of its own — such as
// `error_correction`, where a transcript on screen hands the exercise away — appends it
// from its own validator instead of patching this one.
//
// Two things are carried rather than decided here:
//
//   - **the message**, because the authoring UI is localised into four languages and
//     English prose in shared logic could not be rendered (plan 53 §3.6);
//   - **the step number**, because the layer mounts on builders with four steps and on
//     builders with three. The host says which of its steps owns each part.
