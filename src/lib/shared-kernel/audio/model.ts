// The audio layer — plan 56 §4, from the design handoff
// `design_handoff_audio_exercises/README.md` ("Data model").
//
// This is not a thirteenth exercise type. It is a block any document may carry, and one
// switch inside it turns the exercise it belongs to into a listening exercise: the
// teacher attaches a clip and the rules for hearing it, the student answers the same
// items with a player above them.
//
// Two decisions of plan 56 shape everything here, and both are departures from the
// prototype:
//
//   1. **The source is an asset id, not a URL** (§3.1). A pre-signed URL lives an hour;
//      a document lives years. The platform already made this choice twice — the
//      `[audio:id]` token in a lesson body and the media slot on a `translate` sentence
//      — and a third spelling of it would be a third thing to keep in step.
//   2. **A missing block reads as "off"** (§3.4). Every document written before this
//      plan has no `audio` field, and every one of them must load and play exactly as it
//      did. So nothing reads `ex.audio.x`; everything goes through `audioOf`.
//
// Field names are camelCase (plan 34 §7).

/**
 * Where the clip comes from.
 *
 * `asset` covers the ordinary case — a file the teacher uploaded, held by media-service
 * under `exercise_asset` and readable by any authenticated learner once it is ready.
 * `link` is an external URL. `lesson` borrows the narration of a Read & Listen lesson
 * **by reference**, so replacing it in the lesson replaces it here; it ships last
 * (plan 56 §3.8) because it is the one mode that has to read another aggregate.
 *
 * `items` is the fourth, and it says the clip is not here: each item carries its own
 * recording, in the template's own field (plan 56 phase 6, `items.ts`). It exists because
 * `translate` already worked that way — a set of sentences from different sources, one
 * recording each — and the choice was to make that a source of this layer rather than a
 * second audio control beside it. The rules for hearing then apply to whichever clip is
 * playing, and there is no exercise-level clip, no timecodes and no one transcript.
