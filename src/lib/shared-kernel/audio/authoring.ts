// The authored side of the audio block — plan 56 phase 4.
//
// The problem this file exists for is the mirror of the projection's. Every template's
// `toContent` builds an explicit object out of the fields it knows about, which is right
// — a persistence function that spread whatever it was given would write the builder's
// scratch state into the database — and it means a block belonging to no template would
// be dropped by the first autosave.
//
// So the layer travels beside the document rather than inside the template's type: the
// builder holds an `AudioDraft`, reads it out of the loaded document, and writes it back
// on top of what `toContent` produced. Nine templates, three lines each, and not one of
// their models learns about a field that is not theirs.
//
// The draft keeps the timecodes in a map for the same reason the projection does: an item
// is `questions[]` here, `rows[]` there and `pairs[]` in the third, and a map keyed by
// item id is the one shape that does not care.
