// The playback rules — plan 56 §3.2, from BEHAVIOR.md §5–§8.
//
// The handoff is emphatic that these rules live "in the engine, not in the views", and
// its engine is a React hook around an `HTMLAudioElement`. This file is that engine with
// the element taken out: a reducer over playback events, with no DOM, no timers and no
// framework. Three reasons it is shaped that way rather than ported as a hook:
//
//   1. The web plays through `HTMLAudioElement` and VoxOrd through `react-native-sound`,
//      which has no time events at all and must be polled. One rule set, two adapters —
//      and the reducer cannot tell which of them produced a `time` event.
//   2. "An attempt is spent starting from the top" is a judgement about fairness to a
//      student, and judgements on this platform are tested without a renderer.
//   3. The server may one day count listens (§3.6). When it does, it replays these same
//      events; a hook could not have been reused.
//
// What it deliberately does **not** hold: the position of the audio element. It holds
// what it was last *told* the position is, and answers with an effect describing what the
// adapter should do to the element. The element remains the single source of truth about
// itself.
