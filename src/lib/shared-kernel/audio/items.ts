// Where each template keeps the things a timecode can hang on — plan 56.
//
// The rest of this module is written against "an item", which is what lets one
// implementation serve all thirteen templates. This is the one place that has to know
// more than that, and it is deliberately the only one: the projection needs it to carry
// the timecodes past a per-template projection that would drop them, and the publish
// preflight needs it to find the timecodes worth warning about.
//
// A template missing from the table is not an oversight. `writing_task` has nothing to
// time — its audio is stimulus, not an item — and the two retired forms have no builder
// to write timecodes with. They get the exercise-level rules and nothing else, which is
// all they can fail.

 * Where a template keeps a clip **of its own** on each item — plan 56 phase 6.
 *
 * Only `translate` has one, and it predates this layer: plan 42 gave every sentence its
 * own recording because the sentences come from different sources, which is a shape one
 * clip with timecodes cannot express. Phase 6 does not delete it and does not set a
 * second control beside it — it becomes the fourth `AudioSource` (`items`), so the
 * teacher makes one decision and the rules for hearing apply either way.
 *
 * A template absent from this table simply cannot have per-item clips, and `source:
 * 'items'` on one is an exercise with nothing to play — which is the blocker it should be.
