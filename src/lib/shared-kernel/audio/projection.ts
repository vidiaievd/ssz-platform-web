// What a student may hold of the audio block — plan 56 §3.3.
//
// The transcript of a listening exercise **is the answer**. Not a hint, not context: the
// thing the student is being asked to hear. So it is dosed exactly the way every other
// key on this platform is dosed — withheld by the projection, and delivered by whatever
// already delivers the key — instead of being shipped with the document and hidden by a
// view, which would print the answer in the network tab.
//
// Three policies, three fates:
//
//   never   — withheld, always. The student never sees it.
//   always  — travels with the projection. It is the accommodation path for a
//             hard-of-hearing student, so it must be readable before the answer and even
//             while a `first` gate is closed (README, "Accessibility").
//   after   — withheld here, delivered with the key: with `/answers` for a template the
//             browser grades, and on the verdict for one the server grades.
//
// This step is cross-cutting rather than per-template, and it is the first thing in
// `studentSafeContent` that is. That is right for what it guards: the block is the same
// on all thirteen templates, so thirteen copies of this rule would be twelve chances to
// forget it. It also has to *add* the block back, because the six per-template
// projections build a new object and would otherwise drop the audio entirely.

 * content column, and an item's timecode would not survive the trip — nine projections
 * would each have to learn to carry a field that is not theirs. Gathering them onto the
