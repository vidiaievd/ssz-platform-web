// What a student is allowed to see — IMPLEMENTATION.md's "Security" rule: "the example
// answer, the level descriptors and the point keywords must never reach the student
// client before the teacher has graded. Send the checklist point `text` (the student
// needs it), never `keywords`."
//
// Unlike the other templates' projections, this one takes **both** columns rather than
// the assembled document. The reason is a single setting: with `showRubric: 'always'`
// the level descriptors are a writing guide and have to reach the student *before* the
// mark, but they live in `expected_answers` (persistence.ts). A projection written from
// `content` alone would compile, pass every test that does not know about the setting,
// and silently drop the feature — plan 50 §5 records exactly that trap.
//
// Everything else the answer key holds is unreachable from here by construction: this
// function never assembles a `WritingTask`, so the model answer and the point keywords
// are not values it holds and forgets to strip. It reads `levels`, and nothing else,
// out of the key.
