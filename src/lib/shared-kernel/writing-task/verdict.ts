// The arithmetic behind a teacher's verdict on a `writing_task` — plan 50 §3.2.
//
// The handoff grades a text with a rubric: the teacher sets one mark 0-3 per criterion,
// the score is `Σ mark × weight`, and the verdict follows from `settings.passScore`. The
// platform grades everything else out of items and speaks in percent — the SRS consumer
// reads `score < 60` as a failure (`exercise-attempted.consumer.ts`), so a passed essay
// worth 11 of 15 must not travel as `11`. Both facts live here: the rubric total in
// rubric points, and the same result normalized to the percent every other consumer of
// a score already understands.
//
// Two rules this file exists to keep:
//
// - **The threshold is compared in points, never in percent.** `passScore` is what the
//   author typed into the builder, in the same unit as the marks.
// - **The snapshot, not the live rubric.** Marks are meaningless without the criteria
//   they were set against, so grading reads the copy taken when the submission was
//   queued (IMPLEMENTATION.md's "Persistence": a teacher editing criteria after grading
//   must not change past marks).
//
// Nothing here decides a mark. Marks come from a person; this only adds them up.
