// Grading for `inflection_table`: the whole table at once, and what a check leaves behind.
//
// The mechanics are `sort_into_buckets`' (plan 69 §3.4, plan 66 §3.1): one `Sjekk` sends every
// asked cell; right cells lock; «Prøv de gale på nytt» sends the table again with the wrong ones
// re-answered; the author's budget (1–4 checks) closes it. It runs on the server over the
// server's document — the client supplies forms and nothing else.
//
// ── The score is the first check ────────────────────────────────────────────
// What the engine records is **first-check accuracy over all graded cells**: a cell left empty
// on the first check counts as wrong (plan 66 Q5-A, decision Q6-A here). Later checks change
// what the student sees and never the score; the first form of every cell is carried forward
// (`firstValues`) the way sort carries `firstBuckets`.
//
// ── The bank penalises a false positive ─────────────────────────────────────
// DECISIONS: «Bank mode is scored with a false-positive penalty. Otherwise the student sweeps
// the bank across the grid.» A form placed in a cell it does not belong to costs one right
// cell; an empty cell is simply wrong. In typing mode a wrong cell costs nothing extra (step
// 4). The pass mark is decided in integers, as plans 67 and 68 do.
//
// ── How much of the key a check returns ─────────────────────────────────────
//   * whether each cell is right, its near miss and the author's reason for a wrong one — on
//     every check: DECISIONS §3 wants the student told it was the definite, not that they were
//     close, and the prototype shows both at once (plan 69 §3.5);
//   * the correct form of a wrong cell — by `revealKey`: after any check (`afterFirst`), once
//     the budget is spent (`afterLast`), never (`never`).
//
// Three grains, all recorded on every check (DECISIONS §2): the cell (`cells`), the row
// (`rows`), the table (`pct`/`passed`). Whether the row chip is drawn is a display setting.
