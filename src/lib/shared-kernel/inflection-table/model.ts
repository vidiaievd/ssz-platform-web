// Model for the `inflection_table` exercise.
//
// Source of truth: docs/design/activity-specs/04_design_handoff_inflection_table/ in
// ssz-platform-web (README + DECISIONS + the prototype), as amended by
// docs/plan/69-inflection-table.md.
//
// `en jobb – jobben – jobber – jobbene` is one system, not four gaps. Three ideas from the
// handoff shape everything here:
//
//   1. **One table, not four gaps.** A row is an element with its own verdict; a cell is
//      addressed `rowId:slotId` (`cellKey`) and carries its own key and its own reason.
//   2. **The columns belong to the language pack** (packs.ts). The document records which
//      pack and which version it was authored against, which paradigm, and the subset of
//      that paradigm's slots in play — never a heading of its own.
//   3. **Suggested is not correct.** A row pulled from the course dictionary arrives with
//      suggested forms and a `dictId`; every asked cell still needs an author-confirmed key and
//      an author-written reason (DECISIONS §3).
//
// Field names are camelCase (plan 34 §7). `source` of the prototype is not stored: a row came
// from the dictionary exactly when it has a `dictId` (plan 69 §3.1). The audio block is not
// part of this model — it rides beside the document the way it does for `sort_into_buckets`.
