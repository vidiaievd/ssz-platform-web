// The governing idea: a free answer cannot be compared to a string, so the answer key
// is **semantic elements**. Each element is one thing the answer has to say, carrying
// two or three anchor phrases a student might say it with. An element is covered when
// any one of its anchors appears in the answer as a contiguous run of words.
//
// The verdict follows from element coverage, never from a single similarity score —
// see grading.ts, whose header explains why that distinction is the whole feature.
