// What a student is allowed to see — IMPLEMENTATION.md's rule: "Ship the question
// without `elements`, `model` and `why`; return the verdict, the element labels with
// hit flags, and the model answer only when `showModel` allows it."
//
// The anchors are not merely sensitive here, they are *the answer written in the words
// the student is being asked to find*. So this module never assembles a `Question`: the
// key is not a value it holds and forgets to strip. It reads `model` — and nothing else
// — out of the key, and only under `showModel: 'always'`.
//
// Two traps this file exists to avoid, both found by plan 50:
//
//   1. **`showModel: 'always'` is the one case where part of the key must reach the
//      student early** (self-study mode). A projection written from `content` alone
//      would compile, pass every test that does not know about the setting, and
//      silently drop the feature. Hence both columns as arguments.
//   2. **A projection may be run twice.** The content-service hands the runner a
//      document whose `expectedAnswers` it has already nulled out; `start-attempt` then
//      projects again. The second run must produce a usable question set, not throw and
//      not resurrect anything.
//
// Call it on the server only: it is the thing that takes the key away.
