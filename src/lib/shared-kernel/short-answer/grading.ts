// The grader — README "Verdict (saGrade)" and plan 51 §3.4.
//
// Two rules from IMPLEMENTATION.md that outlive any particular matcher:
//
//   1. **The verdict is derived from element coverage, not from a single score.** The
//      breakdown *is* the feature: the student is told which of the things the answer
//      had to say were said, and a teacher reading the queue sees the same list. A
//      similarity percentage would be cheaper and would say nothing.
//   2. **`modelPasses` must stay true.** Whatever grades students also grades the
//      author's own model answer, and a failure there is a blocker (issues.ts) — if the
//      author's answer does not pass the key, no student's will.
//
// Anything producing `QuestionResult` drops in here — a stemmer, a lemmatiser, an
// embedding similarity. The shape is the contract the runner, the builder and the
// review queue all read.
