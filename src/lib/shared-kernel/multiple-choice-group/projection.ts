// What a student is allowed to see before answering.
//
// For this template that is: the instruction, the columns, the statements as text, the
// passage when the author attached one, and the settings that change what the runner may
// draw. Which column is right, the author's line and the quote that proves it live in the
// key column and arrive from `check` (grading.ts) — never here.
//
// Three things this file is responsible for beyond omission:
//
//   1. **Unready rows never reach the student.** A row with no text or no key is dropped
//      (`readyRows`) — the projection is where that happens, not the runner.
//   2. **The row order is decided server-side** (plan 54 §3.5). A runner that shuffled
//      locally would be shuffling something the network tab had already shown in order.
//      Columns are never shuffled, in this file or anywhere else.
//   3. **`shuffleRows` is applied, not shipped.** A client cannot act on it; it can only
//      contradict what it was sent.
//
// The passage is the one place this projection has to make a judgement rather than a
// deletion. `source.mode: 'inline'` with `showText: false` means the author attached a text
// and then chose not to put it on the exercise screen — so it is withheld here rather than
// sent with a flag saying "do not draw this", which is the same text one devtools tab away.

 * nothing — knowing that a second check exists is not knowing which rows are wrong.
 *
 * `passThreshold` is carried for the same kind of reason: BEHAVIOR shows the pass mark in
 * the summary («P% riktig — kravet er T%»), and a student who is told the requirement after
 * failing it learns less than one who knew it going in. It cannot be gamed — the score is
 * computed on the server either way.
 *
 * `lockCorrect` and `revealKey` are **not** carried. Both are decisions the server makes and
 * hands down in the check result: `locked` says which rows are frozen, `keyColumnId` appears
 * or does not. A client told `lockCorrect: false` could unfreeze rows the server froze.
