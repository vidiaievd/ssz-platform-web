// Grading for `multiple_choice_group`: the whole table at once, and what a check leaves
// behind.
//
// The unit of work is the group, so unlike `multiple_choice` there is no per-question
// judge here — there is one `check`, and its result decides three things at the same time:
// the score, whether the table is closed, and which rows the student may still edit.
//
// The key does not reach the browser (plan 54 §3.2), so this runs on the server and hands
// back only what the student is allowed to know at that moment. That "at that moment" is
// the substance:
//
//   * which rows are wrong comes back on every check — it is the point of checking;
//   * **which column was right comes back only once the table closes** — right, revealed,
//     or out of attempts. Sending the key with a wrong row that still has a retry left
//     would make the retry theatre (README, "showKey = closed && settings.revealKey");
//   * the per-row explanation follows `showWhy`, and a row with neither `why` nor `quote`
//     renders no block at all even under `always` (IMPLEMENTATION.md test checklist).
//
// ── On what "score" means here ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// BEHAVIOR §7 is explicit and differs from `multiple_choice`: the score reflects the
// **current** answers, not the first pass. A student who fixes their mistakes under
// `retry: 'one'` scores 100%, and the attempt count is what distinguishes them.
//
// That is safe to follow only because the platform already separates the two questions.
// `Attempt.score()` publishes `AttemptScoredEvent` when `recheckCount === 0` alone, so the
// SRS sees the first check and nothing else, whatever a later re-check does to the number
// on screen (plan 54 §3.3). Were that not so, this contract would hand the SRS a corrected
// table as evidence that the text was understood.
