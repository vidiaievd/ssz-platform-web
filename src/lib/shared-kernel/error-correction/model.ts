// The governing rule: **the author writes two sentences, the engine derives the errors.**
// A mistake is never stored as a list entry — it is the difference between `wrong` and
// `ref`, recomputed on every read (see engine.ts). The author only ever overrides what
// was derived, keyed by a key that is itself derived, so an override cannot outlive the
// mistake it explains.
//
// The second rule, from the same handoff: **store the student's edits, not the finished
// text.** Everything the teacher UI and the diagnostics need — which mistakes were
// touched, which were hit, what was changed where there was no mistake — follows from
// the edits and cannot be recovered from a rewritten sentence.
