// What a student is allowed to see — BEHAVIOR.md §C.1: "the student must never see
// *which* words are wrong before grading, only how many mistakes are left".
//
// Both directions of that rule live here. `toStudentProjection` is what the server sends
// when an attempt starts; `selfCheckFeedback` is what it may answer during the attempt.
// Neither can leak the key by accident, because neither is handed the key in a form it
// could pass on: everything they return is a count, a type, or text the author wrote for
// the student to read.
