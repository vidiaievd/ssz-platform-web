// Model for the `translate_to_target` / `translate_from_target` exercises.

// Source of truth: docs/design/activity-specs/design_handoff_translate/DATA_MODEL.md
// in ssz-platform-web, as amended by the decisions in docs/plan/42-translate.md.
//
// The governing rule, from the handoff: **the auto-check can only ever approve.** A
// translation that does not match the key may still be a perfectly good translation the
// author never thought of, so the single automatic outcome is a hit on a variant of the
// key. Everything else is a diff and a sort order for a human — which is why `Routing`
// has two members and only one of them is reachable without a teacher.
//
// The second rule: an exercise is a *set* of sentences with one submission. The type it
// replaces held exactly one sentence and no set, and every count in the builder (variants,
// coverage, explanations) exists because a set is where authoring quality stops being
// visible by eye.
