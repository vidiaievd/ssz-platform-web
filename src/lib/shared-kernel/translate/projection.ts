// What a student is allowed to see — BEHAVIOR.md, "Само-проверка": the self-check
// teaches, it does not hand over the key.
//
// Both directions of that rule live here. `toStudentProjection` is what the server sends
// when an attempt starts; `selfCheckFeedback` is what it may answer during the attempt.
//
// The one rule worth stating twice: in the working phase, `missing` words of the diff are
// replaced by `•••`. A student who can run the self-check three times against a visible
// `missing` list can reconstruct the key one word at a time, and the exercise becomes a
// typing test. The exception is `showRefs: 'afterSubmit'`, where the key is about to be
// shown anyway and hiding it buys nothing.
