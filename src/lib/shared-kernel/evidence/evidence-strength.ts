 * (plan 55 §3.9 rule 2). A weight table invented next to the projection would drift from
 * the ceilings here within one plan.
 *
 * The two types below are mirrored rather than imported: the kernel deliberately depends
 * on nothing, so `@ssz/contracts` cannot be reached from here. They are structurally the

/**
 * How much knowledge one successful answer actually proves (plan 36 §B.1).
 *
 * This is **not** a weight on the exercise and not a multiplier on points. FSRS
 * models memory of one item, and the rating is a signal for "how easily did it come
 * back". So the right lever is a *ceiling on the rating by the form of the answer*:
 * scoring 100 by picking a word out of five given ones is not the same evidence as
 * scoring 100 by typing it from memory, and today both land on EASY.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the part that is easy to forget: **on failure it runs the other
 * way.** Getting it wrong while choosing from five given words is a strong signal of
 * not knowing — the hint was as large as it gets. Getting it wrong while typing it
 * out can happen to someone who knows the word perfectly well: a typo, `kj` against
 * `skj`, a doubled consonant. Hence:
 *
 *   - weak form: success means little, failure means a lot;
 *   - strong form: success means a lot, failure means less than it looks.
 *
 * The ceilings below are a judgement, not a measurement. They are deliberately set
 * from the head and refined against the telemetry of §A.1 — a system with ceilings
 * guessed at is still closer to the truth than today's, which has none at all.

  // gave: the answer is produced from nothing — one to three sentences in the learner's
  // own words, with nothing on screen to copy from. What changed is the checking. The
  // old form matched the line against a list of accepted strings; the new one asks
  // whether the things the answer had to say were said, an element at a time, by anchor
  // phrase now and by AI later, with a teacher last. So coverage is not the same fact as
  // a word recalled correctly: an element can go uncovered because the learner said it
  // in a phrasing the key does not list, which is a gap in the key rather than in the
  // memory. That is what the floor is for — a `partial` scores low enough for
  // `scoreToRating` to call AGAIN, and HARD is where it lands instead, so an incomplete
  // answer does not reset an interval it never disproved. The cap stays at the top.
  short_answer: FREE_PRODUCTION,
  // Still the strongest evidence after plan 50, and for a slightly different reason: the
  // answer is now a whole text a teacher reads and marks against a rubric, not a line
  // matched against a key. Nothing narrows it and nothing is machine-scored, so the cap
  // stays at the top; the floor stays off AGAIN because a rubric can fail a text on
  // structure or length while every word in it was recalled correctly. The checklist
  // ticks the runner sends alongside the text are self-report and rate nothing.
  writing_task: FREE_PRODUCTION,
  // Still typed from nothing after plan 42, only a set of sentences at a time rather than
  // one — the form of the answer did not change, so neither does the row. One soft edge:
  // an exercise with `dir: "both"` is stored under this code, so its target→explain
  // sentences are rated here rather than by the row below. Not worth a code of its own
  // until `both` is split out for analytics.
  translate_to_target: FREE_PRODUCTION,
  // Typed from memory. Superseded by word_bank_gap_fill, which reports its form
  // directly; kept for events still carrying the old code.
  fill_in_blank: FREE_PRODUCTION,
  // Finding the error is genuine recall, and the correction is written out. Failing
  // may still be a slip in the correction rather than blindness to the error.
  error_correction: FREE_PRODUCTION,

  // Into the learner's own language: comprehension rather than production. Real, but
  // it never shows they could produce the target form. Failure is held off the floor
  // because the answer is typed and typos are the learner's own language's problem.

  // Plan 53 kept the rating and replaced the ground under `multiple_choice`. A question
  // is now one of a set played against the server, and the author may hand out a second
  // try and a 50/50 that removes wrong options: a success can therefore be arrived at by
  // elimination rather than recalled, and the event that reaches here reports only where
  // the learner ended up, not how many tries it took. That is a weaker argument than the
  // sentence above, not a stronger one — the same caveat plan 52 wrote onto
  // `sentence_schema` and plan 49 onto `match_pairs` — and it pushes down, while
  // CLOSED_SET is already the cautious end of recognition. So the row stands; it is here
  // by decision, not by oversight. The two codes below still hold the plain reading.

  // changing the rating — the bank may carry distractors, so what is on screen is no
  // longer exactly the answer; and a sentence may be checked as often as the learner
  // likes, so a success can be converged on by trying, the same caveat that costs
  // `match_pairs` its old argument below. Both push down rather than up, and CLOSED_SET
  // is already the cautious end of recognition.

  // distractors, so the last slot is not correct by construction any more. What replaced
  // that argument is weaker evidence, not stronger: a check is partial and unlimited, so
  // a learner can converge on the right grid by trying, and the event that reaches here
  // reports the state they converged to. Until an attempt says how many checks it took,
  // a success here is worth about what elimination used to be worth.
