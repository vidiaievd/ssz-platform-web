 * How much one answer proves about **one atom inside it** (plan 63 phase 5).
 *
 * `evidenceStrength` answers a narrower question: how much the answer proves at all,
 * from the form it was produced in. That is the right ceiling for a card standing for
 * the exercise or the gap, where the thing being remembered *is* the thing that was
 * answered. It is the wrong ceiling for an atom, because an atom can sit inside an
 * item without being what the item asked: the same correct sentence is a full recall
 * of the verb form it was testing and almost nothing about the noun that happened to
 * be in it.
 *
 * So two more axes narrow the form's verdict, and only ever narrow it:
 *
 *   - **role** — what the author said this item was doing with the atom;
 *   - **modality** — how the answer had to be known, where the form could not say.
 *
 * The result feeds the same `clampByEvidence` as everything else.

 * of this bug is exactly what phase 5 exists to fix: in one attempt the word
 * `stillingsannonse` was rated `GOOD` as a gap and `AGAIN` as a word.

 * that merely needed it — and among equals, the **worse** outcome wins. A lapse is the
 * informative half of an attempt, and letting a success elsewhere in the same exercise
 * hide it would keep the card on a schedule the learner has just disproved.
