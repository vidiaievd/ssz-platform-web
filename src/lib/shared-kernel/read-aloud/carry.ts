// What a returned `read_aloud` leaves standing for the next try (plan 70, phase 11b, variant B).
//
// A teacher returns a submission when one prompt fails, but rules on every prompt. The prompts
// that passed stay passed: the next attempt starts with them **carried** — the recording, the
// marks, the teacher's comment and the attempt they were passed in, frozen — and the student
// records only the prompts that failed. The exercise is passed when every prompt is, carried
// and new alike.
//
// Why not re-record everything: the memory already heard about the passed prompt on the return
// (`gapResults`), and a second success minutes later would read as a second review at no
// interval; the prompt could regress on a bad take and lose a pass it had earned; and the
// teacher would grade the same recording twice.
//
// A carried prompt lives in the submission itself — `SubmittedRecording.carried` — so an attempt
// is complete on its own: the queue, the verdict, the learner's card and the try after this one
// all read it from the attempt's own column, never by walking back the chain. A prompt carried
// twice keeps the attempt it was first passed in.
//
// What the student is told before recording is only which prompts are carried and from which
// try (`CarriedPrompt`) — they were shown the marks and the comment on the return already, and
// the projection adds nothing to that.
