//
// One passage, up to four questions over it, the answers marked in the text. Three ideas
// from the handoff shape everything here:
//
//   1. **A mark is a run of whole tokens.** Stored as character offsets into `text`
//      (`start`, `end` — the first token's start, the last token's end), worked on as token
//      indices; the conversion is coordinates.ts and nowhere else.
//   2. **A mark is never silently lost.** Editing the passage re-anchors every span by its
//      words and their order of occurrence; a span that cannot be found becomes an orphan,
//      and orphans block assignment (reanchor.ts).
//   3. **An extra mark costs something.** `settings.penalty` — without it, marking the whole
//      paragraph scores full marks (grading.ts).
//
// Field names are camelCase (plan 34 §7). The author's focus (grammar / vocabulary) is *not*
// a field: decision Q1-A of plan 66, carried over as deviation 14 of plan 67.
