// The passage once, its paragraph ranges, and per ready question its id, prompt, unit and —
// only under `showCount` — how many marks are expected. No spans, no `why`, no hints, no
// threshold, no penalty, no orphans — ever (AC-S11). "A client that can compute the score can
// leak it": the verdict, the pass and the penalty all come from the server's check.
//
// Question ids are the authored ids, not per-attempt opaque refs (plan 67 §5, deviation 2):
// the key lives in the other column, an id is random and encodes nothing.
