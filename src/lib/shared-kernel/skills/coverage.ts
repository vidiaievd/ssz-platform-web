// Rolling many exercises up into what a lesson, a module or a course actually trains —
// plan 55 §3.7.
//
// Three tallies, and **the third matters more than the first two**: a course can be
// impeccably balanced across the four skills and still consist, 84% of it, of picking an
// answer out of a list. `bySkill` and `byFocus` cannot see that; `byForm` can.
//
// Every bucket is always present, including the zeroes. That is the rule of §3.10 and it
// is the whole reason this returns records rather than the entries it happened to see:
// "this course has no listening" is the single most useful sentence the report can say,
// and it looks exactly like a missing key if the zeroes are dropped.
