// Rolling many exercises up into what a lesson, a module or a course actually trains —
// plan 55 §3.7.
//
// Three tallies, and **the third matters more than the first two**: a course can be
// impeccably balanced across the four skills and still consist, 84% of it, of picking an
// answer out of a list. `bySkill` and `byFocus` cannot see that; `byForm` can.
//
// Every bucket is always present, including the zeroes. That is the rule of §3.10 and it
// is the whole reason this returns records rather than the entries it happened to see:
// "this course has no listening" is the single most useful sentence the report can say,
// and it looks exactly like a missing key if the zeroes are dropped.

 * The table itself, not its two margins: how many exercises train this skill *and* this

 *
 * The margins cannot answer that. A course whose `bySkill.listening` is 12 and whose
 * `byFocus.grammar` is 40 may contain no listening-grammar exercise at all, and a reader
 * who multiplies the two margins is inventing a cell. Screen E of plan 58 asks exactly
 * this question — "covered but unreached" against "not taught at all" — and the
 * difference between those two sentences is a cell of this table being zero or not.
 *
 * An exercise carrying two skills and two subjects is counted in all four cells, for the
 * same reason the margins double-count: the question is "does anything here train this
 * pair", not "how do the exercises divide up".
