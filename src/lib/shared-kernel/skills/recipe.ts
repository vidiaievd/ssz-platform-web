// What a lesson is expected to train — plan 64 §2б, decisions L–Q.
//
// A recipe is a short list of rules about the axes, never about template codes:
// "at least one element whose output is not `none`", "no more than 60 % of elements
// answered by recognition", "at least one element heard rather than read". Types are
// redefined, retired and added from one plan to the next, so a recipe written as
// "two `fill_in_blank` and one `multiple_choice`" goes stale within a plan — and an
// author who follows it to the letter can still build a lesson that is recognition from
// top to bottom while the recipe reports that all is well. The interface names the types
// that would close a failed rule; the rule itself does not know them (decision L).
//
// **Elements are counted, not exercises** (decision M). A set of eight multiple-choice
// questions is eight acts of recognition, not one; counted per exercise, one of them
// would "balance" one piece of writing. An element is an `ExerciseItemTarget.itemKey` —
// the same unit the subject axis is weighed in (decision H) — and an exercise whose
// elements nobody addressed counts as one.
//
// **Minimums, and shares only as ceilings** (decision N). "At least one" holds in a
// lesson of two elements and in a lesson of twenty; "30 % production" in a lesson of
// three elements is noise. A share is the right word only for balance, which is a ceiling.
//
// **A failed rule is a warning, never a gate** (decision P), on the same terms as
// `issues.ts`: an unbalanced lesson is still a publishable lesson. An empty recipe is a
// legitimate state too — the platform does not impose a method.
//
// Every rule reads `modality` for "how the answer had to be known", not `form` and not
// the `retrieval` axis the plan first proposed: decision G gave that role to `modality`,
// and a recipe in a vocabulary the report does not show would be unverifiable.
