// What each exercise template trains, when nothing more specific is known — plan 55 §3.4,
// bottom rung of the chain.
//
// Written the way `evidence-strength.ts` is written, and for the same reason: **a table
// of judgements must argue for itself.** Every row below says why it holds what it
// holds, because the alternative is a table nobody dares change in a year's time.
//
// Two rules govern the whole table:
//
// 1. **The axis is about the target language.** Producing a sentence in the language of
//    explanation is not written production in the language being learnt. This is what
//    splits the two translate templates: one is `written`, the other is `reading`.
// 2. **A hint is given only where it is structural.** Where a template genuinely could
//    be about vocabulary or about grammar depending on what the author wrote, the focus
//    is left empty rather than guessed. An empty focus is visible in the report as
//    `unknown` and is a truthful statement; a guessed one is noise that cannot be
//    distinguished from a measurement.

 * All thirteen template codes of the catalogue, including the two officially retired.
 *
 * `fill_in_blank` and `word_bank_fill` are absorbed by `word_bank_gap_fill` (plan 35) but
 * carry ~135 exercises between them, and the general authoring form still opens them.
 * A coverage report that skipped them would under-count a third of the catalogue.

  // which given word fits. That is reading, not writing, however sentence-shaped the
  // result looks on screen.

  // The one template whose document genuinely decides: it absorbed `fill_in_blank`, so

  // Two moves in one: spot what is wrong (reading, closely) and write the correction
  // (written). The focus hint is the one case where the premise of the type *is* the
  // subject — an exercise built around a broken form is about form.

  // Chunks are dragged into fields — given pieces, arranged. The learner does not spell
  // anything, so the form is `bank`, but the channel is written production: what is being
  // built is a sentence in the target language, and word order is the whole point. Hence
  // the one unambiguous grammar hint in the table.
