// What each exercise template trains, when nothing more specific is known — plan 55 §3.4,
// bottom rung of the chain.
//
// Written the way `evidence-strength.ts` is written, and for the same reason: **a table
// of judgements must argue for itself.** Every row below says why it holds what it
// holds, because the alternative is a table nobody dares change in a year's time.
//
// Since plan 64 (decision F) a row does not name its channels. It says what goes in and
// what comes out, and `channelsOf` in `model.ts` reads the CEFR channels off the pair —
// so a recording added by the document or by the lesson changes the input and leaves
// the output alone, instead of replacing the whole list.
//
// Two rules govern the whole table:
//
// 1. **The axis is about the target language.** Producing a sentence in the language of
//    explanation is not written production in the language being learnt
//    (`written_l1`), and reading a prompt in it is not reading (`input: 'none'`). This is
//    what splits the two translate templates: one is `written`, the other is `reading`.
// 2. **A hint is given only where it is structural.** Where a template genuinely could
//    be about vocabulary or about grammar depending on what the author wrote, the focus
//    is left empty rather than guessed. An empty focus is visible in the report as
//    `unknown` and is a truthful statement; a guessed one is noise that cannot be
//    distinguished from a measurement.
