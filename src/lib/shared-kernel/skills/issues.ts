// Remarks about the balance of a module — plan 55 §1.7 and the decision in §12.6 of the
// audit.
//
// Same shape as the nine per-type kernels: a code and the numbers its message needs,
// never the message itself, because the authoring UI is localised into four languages
// and English prose in shared logic could not be rendered (plan 53 §3.6).
//
// **Not one blocker in this file, and that is a decision rather than an oversight.** An
// unbalanced lesson stays a publishable lesson. A publish gate on coverage would not be
// validation — it would be taste wearing the uniform of a rule, and the first author to
// meet it would learn to add one throwaway listening exercise to get past it.
