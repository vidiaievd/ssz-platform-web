// The axes an exercise is measured on — plan 55 §3.1–3.3.
//
// Three axes, deliberately separate, because collapsing them is the mistake this module
// exists to prevent:
//
//   skill — the channel: listening / reading / spoken / written
//   focus — the subject: vocabulary / grammar / orthography / pragmatics
//   form  — how the answer was produced (bank / free), which already lives in
//           `AnswerForm` and `evidence-strength.ts` and is only *counted* here
//
// The tempting single list — "reading, grammar, listening, speaking" — mixes two of
// them. **Grammar is not a skill.** It is a competence that operates inside all four
// channels, and a learner can know a rule perfectly and still not hear it in running
// speech. One scale glues those two facts together and the diagnosis stops being
// actionable.
//
// `skill` is not a new vocabulary: it is `CanDoSkill` from content-service, the same
// four CEFR channels the can-do descriptor library is written against
// (`prisma/seed-can-do.ts`, 17 global descriptors A1–B2). A second, parallel list would
// mean the coverage report and can-do progress could never be compared.
