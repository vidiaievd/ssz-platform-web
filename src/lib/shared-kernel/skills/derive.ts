// Deriving what an exercise trains — plan 55 §3.4.
//
// The decision this file encodes: **the axis is derived, not authored.** 452 seeded
// exercises get their axes for no authoring work at all, and the coverage report is
// truthful on the day it ships. Hand-tagging would mean the report lies until somebody
// tags the catalogue — that is to say, always.
//
// The chain for `skill`, first rung that fires wins outright:
//
//   1. override   — the author said so
//   2. placement  — where the exercise stands in the lesson
//   3. document   — a flag inside the exercise itself
//   4. template   — the table in by-template.ts
//
// Placement outranks the template because of a fact in the schema, not a preference:
// `LessonListeningStage` links a lesson variant to an `Exercise` by foreign key, and an
// exercise standing as a listening stage **is** listening, whatever template sits under
// it. A `short_answer` about a recording is not a reading exercise.
//
// `focus` has its own, shorter chain — override → atoms → template — because placement
// and the document say nothing about the subject. Two chains means two sources reported;
// one combined `source` would have to lie about one of them.

 * cannot express a nullable array, so the marker is a separate column (plan 55 §3.5).
 *
 * One marker covers both axes, so **a partial override is not expressible**: speaking
 * about the skill means speaking about the focus too. Deliberate. Two markers would let
