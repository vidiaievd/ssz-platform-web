// What a student is allowed to see before writing — SPEC_api_contract §2, AC-R3, AC-X2.
//
// The instruction, the shape, per ready segment its id — and its word count only under
// `showWordCount`, because a length is part of the answer. No sentence, no reason, no focus
// word, no orphan, no transcript, no marking rules, no language, no pass mark — ever. The
// verdict, the pass and the score come from the server's check (plan 68 §5, deviation 15).
//
// The audio block is not added here: content-service and the engine put it on with the audio
// layer's `withStudentAudio`, which also gathers the segments' timecodes onto
// `audio.segments` — the same path every audio-capable type takes.
//
// Segment ids are the authored ids (plan 68 §5, deviation 2): the key lives in the other
// column, and an id is random and encodes nothing.
