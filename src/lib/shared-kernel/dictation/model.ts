// A recording, the sentences said in it, the rules for what counts as an error and the
// reasons the student is given. Three ideas from the handoff shape everything here:
//
//   1. **A sentence is an element.** One segment = one field = one verdict = one `itemKey`.
//      `mode: 'whole'` is exactly one segment over the whole clip (DECISIONS §1).
//   2. **An error has a name.** The diff classifies every deviation, and a word the author
//      marked as the point of the dictation is reported by name — never as «almost right»
//      (diff.ts, DECISIONS §3, §5).
//   3. **The key never reaches the browser early.** Segment text, reasons and focus words
//      live in `expected_answers` (persistence.ts) and travel only inside a verdict.
//
// The recording is the shared audio block of plan 56, always switched on. A segment's
// timecode is that layer's per-item `audio {start, end}` — the same field every other type's
// items use, so the layer's projection carries it to the student with no code here.
//
// Field names are camelCase (plan 34 §7). Ids are stable and random, never ordinals.
