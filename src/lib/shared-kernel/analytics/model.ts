// What a cell of an analytics grid is — plan 58 §2, DATA_MODEL §2.
//
// The rule this module exists for: **a cell may never say "0%" when the truth is "we do
// not know"**. Four of the five kinds of emptiness are more common today than full data
// (no `classwork`, `focus` mostly `unknown`, `listening` zero, most cells under the
// sample threshold), so the empty kinds are not edge cases here — they are the normal
// answer, and each one is a different sentence to a teacher.
//
// The state is decided here rather than at each surface because four endpoints and six
// screens have to agree on it. A grid that computed its own would eventually disagree
// with the chart beside it about the same learner, which is the one thing §5 of the
// data model forbids.

/**
 * Every way a cell can be, in the order of the priority rule below.
 *
 * `low` is not a kind of emptiness: it is the bottom of the measured scale. "Bad" and
 * "very bad" are one quantity, and splitting them would invent a boundary nobody asked
 * for; splitting "bad" from "not measured" is the whole point of the list.
