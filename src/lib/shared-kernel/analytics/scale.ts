// The arithmetic every analytics surface shares — plan 58, DECISIONS §O9 and DATA_MODEL §5.
//
// Two things live here for the same reason: the school's student list and a group's
// roster once printed two different numbers for the same learner (plan 57, phase 8),
// because one kept `0..1` and the other rounded percentages of its own. Rounding in one
// place is the fix; the place is here, so that both the service and the client round
// identically.

/**
 * `0..1` as whole percent, or `null` when nothing was measured.
 *
 * `null` in, `null` out — deliberately not `0`. Every caller has to decide what to draw
 * for "we do not know", and a helper that answered `0` would make that decision for them
 * silently, in the wrong direction.
