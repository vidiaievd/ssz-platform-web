// Only what the runner draws before a probe is handed out, and what the reader card says: the
// title, the instruction, the contrast's label, the number of probes, the listening budget and
// the feedback switches. **No pair, no word, no clip and no asset id** — which clip is which
// word is the answer, and probes arrive one at a time from the engine. No pass mark either: it
// comes back with the result (plan 72 §5, row 13).

 * The projection of an assignment (plan 72 Q6-A): one try per probe, as every dosed type gets
 * one check per item in `GRADED`. The verdict, the A/B comparison and the reveal stay as the
 * author set them — they are the exercise, and the key of one probe says nothing about the
 * next. The engine judges by `maxTries(feedback, graded)` either way; this is so the runner
 * draws what the judge will do. Anything that is not a projection is handed back untouched.
