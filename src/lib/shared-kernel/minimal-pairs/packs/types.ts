/**
 * What synthetic speech does to a contrast (DECISIONS §2):
 *   ok    — a neutral voice reproduces it reliably
 *   risky — reproduced, but engine-dependent; publishable with a warning
 *   no    — the engine merges exactly the distinction under test. A blocker, and the TTS button
 *           is disabled rather than warned: the exercise would teach the merger.
