// Model for the `match_pairs` exercise, variants `halves` and `pairs`.
//
// Source of truth: docs/design/activity-specs/design_handoff_match_pairs/SPEC_data_model.md
// in ssz-platform-web, as amended by the decisions in docs/plan/49-match-pairs.md.
//
// The governing rule, as in `word_bank_gap_fill`: **store what the teacher typed, derive
// everything else.** The right-hand pool, its numbering, coverage and validity are never
// persisted — see selectors.ts. A pair is written once, whole, split at the point the
// student must think about: `right` *is* the answer for `left`, so there is no answer key
// to keep in sync and nothing can drift.

/**
 * What the two columns mean, which is a difference in kind and not only in copy.
 *
 * - `halves` — one sentence cut in two. The right half is wrong because of grammar the
 *   student cannot see unaided, which is why an explanation is required to publish.
 * - `pairs` — word ↔ translation, term ↔ definition. The right half is wrong because it
 *   belongs to another left half, which the student can see for themselves.
 *
 * The spec is written for `halves`; every exercise on the platform today is `pairs`. One
 * model serves both (SPEC_data_model, "Reserved: other match_pairs variants") and the
 * variant changes copy, the reading-font treatment, and the level of `FB_NO_DEFAULT`.

 * Deliberately **not** the `PairId`, which is what the spec prescribes (SPEC_data_model,
 * "Key identity rule"). The spec then has to hand the student opaque per-attempt ids to
 * stop the payload from being the answer key (AC-S15), and that costs a mapping stored
 * on every attempt. An id of its own, minted from the same generator for answers and
 * distractors alike, buys the same guarantee for nothing: slots and pool items share no
 * identifier, and the pool order is still shuffled server-side per attempt.
 *
 * See docs/plan/49-match-pairs.md, decision 2.
