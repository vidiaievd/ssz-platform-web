// The student projection: what may leave the server before a check.
//
// For most exercise templates `content` is safe to serve as it stands — the answers live
// in a separate column. This one stores each pair whole, so the answer to "which half
// completes this sentence" is the neighbouring field, and serving the content raw would
// ship every answer to the browser the moment the exercise opens.
//
// BEHAVIOR §2.4: "the pool must not disclose which halves are answers". This function is
// the cut. Two properties it must keep, both asserted in the tests:
//
//   1. No slot and no pool item ever share an identifier (AC-S15). Slots are keyed by
//      `PairId`, pool items by `RightId`, and the two are minted independently — see the
//      note on `RightId` in model.ts.
//   2. Answers and distractors are indistinguishable: same shape, no flag, no ordering
//      that mirrors the slots.
