// Deterministic, seeded shuffling — README "mcShuffled".
//
// Two rules the handoff states and this file keeps:
//
//   1. **Seeded and reproducible.** The same student sees a stable order within an
//      attempt, and a test can assert an order rather than a set.
//   2. **`fixed` options are appended last, in author order.** "Alle over" that floats
//      into the middle of the list is a bug the reader sees before the author does.
//
// Where the seed comes from is a caller's decision, and plan 53 §3.4 makes it: the server
// seeds per attempt, so a reload does not re-deal the options and the order the server
// numbered the 50/50 by is the order the student is looking at.

/** A Fisher–Yates pass driven by a linear congruential generator (Numerical Recipes). */

 * Order one question's options: everything shuffled except the pinned ones, which follow

 * preview can drive with a stable seed while the server drives it with a per-attempt one.
