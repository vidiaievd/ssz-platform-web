// Grading for `multiple_choice`: one picked option at a time, and the attempt as a whole.
//
// The whole file exists because of plan 53 §3.2 — the key does not reach the browser, so
// the judge runs on the server and hands back only what the student is allowed to know at
// that moment. That "at that moment" is the substance:
//
//   * the key comes back **only once the question closes** — correct, revealed, or out of
//     attempts. Sending it with a wrong pick that still has a retry left would make both
//     the retry and the 50/50 theatre (IMPLEMENTATION.md, "Grading payload");
//   * the rule (`Question.why`) follows the same rule, plus `explainOnCorrect`;
//   * the rebuttal (`Option.why`) is the picked option's own, under `showWhyWrong`.
//
// Everything here is pure: the 50/50 takes a seed rather than reaching for randomness, so
// the same wrong pick eliminates the same distractor on a reload.
