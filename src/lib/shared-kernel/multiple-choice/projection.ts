// What a student is allowed to see before answering.
//
// For this template that is a short list, and the shortness is the point: the question,
// the options as text, and the settings that change what the runner may draw. Which
// option is right, the rule behind it and every rebuttal live in the key column and
// arrive one pick at a time, from `judge` (grading.ts) — never here.
//
// Three things this file is responsible for beyond omission:
//
//   1. **Empty options never reach the student**, and the letters renumber accordingly.
//      They are persisted as authored (persistence.ts) and dropped here.
//   2. **The order is decided server-side** (plan 53 §3.4). A runner that shuffled locally
//      would be shuffling something the network tab had already shown in order, and would
//      number the options differently from the server that computed the 50/50.
//   3. **`shuffle` and `shuffleQuestions` are applied, not shipped.** A client cannot act
//      on them; it can only contradict what it was sent.
//
// Unlike `short_answer` and `writing_task`, this projection needs the content column
// alone: no setting reveals part of the key early, so there is nothing for a second
// argument to carry.
