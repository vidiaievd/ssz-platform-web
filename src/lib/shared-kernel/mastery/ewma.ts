// Folding one attempt into a cell — plan 55 §3.9 rule 1.
//
// An exponentially weighted average rather than a lifetime one, because **weakness has to
// expire**: a learner who sorted their grammar out in July must not still read as weak in
// September on the strength of June. A lifetime mean cannot forget, and a profile that
// cannot forget stops describing the learner and starts describing their history.
//
// The evidence weight enters as a *rate*, not as a count: a thin attempt moves the average
// a little way, a strong one moves it far. That is the same statement as "twenty
// four-option questions are not twenty free answers", made continuous.
