// How much one attempt counts toward the profile — plan 55 §3.9 rule 2.
//
// **Read off the evidence ceilings, not invented beside them.** The table in
// `../evidence` already states, per form of answer, how much a success proves and how
// much a failure proves; a second table of weights would be the same judgement written
// twice, and the two copies would part company in the first plan that touched one of them.
//
// The translation is mechanical, and it is the whole of the idea:
//
//   a success is worth its ceiling      — EASY caps mean "this proves everything"
//   a failure is worth its floor's slack — an AGAIN floor means "no excuses here"
//
// So typing a word from memory and getting it right weighs 1, picking it out of five
// weighs 2/3, and picking it out of two weighs 1/3 — while getting it *wrong* runs the
// other way, because a wrong answer with five words on screen is damning and a wrong
// answer typed out may be a doubled consonant.
