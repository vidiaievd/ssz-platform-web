// Which cell to work on next, and where to keep quiet — plan 55 §3.9 rule 3 and §3.10.
//
// The rule this file exists for: **below the threshold there is no verdict.** "Weak at
// listening" said on the strength of three attempts is worse than saying nothing, because
// it will be acted on — a teacher will assign listening work the learner may not need.
// So a cell under the threshold is returned in its own list with its own status, never
// sorted in among the answers with a quiet caveat attached.
//
// And the cells with no attempts at all are the second half of §3.10: "no data about
// listening" usually means "there is no listening in this course", which is the coverage
// report's finding arriving from the other side. It is an answer, not an absence, and it
// is the one worth acting on first.

/**
 * Why a cell is weak, as a teacher would say it — plan 58, DECISIONS §O6.
 *
 * `meanStability` is the only number that tells the two apart, and they demand opposite
 * lessons: a learner who forgets needs the same material again sooner, a learner who
 * never knew it needs it taught differently. Both produce the same run of poor ratings,
 * so a screen that printed only the percentage would leave the teacher guessing.
 *
 *   forgets    — gets it right, loses it fast (stability short for this learner)
 *   never-knew — stable, and stably wrong: the wrong rule is what was learnt
 *   watch      — inside the acting range, named only to explain why it is listed
 *
 * `null` is a fourth answer and an honest one: with no stability recorded there is
 * nothing to tell "forgets" from "never knew", and the screen has to say the pair is
 * weak without claiming to know which. The design pack names three labels; inventing a
 * label for a learner whose memory was never observed would be the kind of claim the
 * whole pack exists to avoid.
