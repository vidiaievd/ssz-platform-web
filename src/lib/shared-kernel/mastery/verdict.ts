// Which cell to work on next, and where to keep quiet — plan 55 §3.9 rule 3 and §3.10.
//
// The rule this file exists for: **below the threshold there is no verdict.** "Weak at
// listening" said on the strength of three attempts is worse than saying nothing, because
// it will be acted on — a teacher will assign listening work the learner may not need.
// So a cell under the threshold is returned in its own list with its own status, never
// sorted in among the answers with a quiet caveat attached.
//
// And the cells with no attempts at all are the second half of §3.10: "no data about
// listening" usually means "there is no listening in this course", which is the coverage
// report's finding arriving from the other side. It is an answer, not an absence, and it
// is the one worth acting on first.
