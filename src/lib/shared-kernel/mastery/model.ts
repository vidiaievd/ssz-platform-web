// The mastery profile — plan 55 §3.9.
//
// One cell per (skill × focus): "how is this learner doing at grammar, in reading". The
// projection over these cells lives in analytics; everything that decides *what a cell
// becomes* lives here, pure, because it is a judgement that has to be tested and has to
// stay the same in every service that ever reads it.
//
// Three metrics, and they are not interchangeable (§3.9):
//
//   successRateEwma      — does it come out right
//   meanStability        — does it stay in memory ("forgets" ≠ "never knew")
//   medianSecondsPerItem — does it come easily (fluency at the same percentage)
