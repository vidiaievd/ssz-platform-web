/**
 * Does this surface form belong to that dictionary word — plan 63, phase 1.
 *
 * Needed because the two are almost never spelled the same. A gap in a real seeded exercise
 * answers `stillingsannonser`; the vocabulary list holds `stillingsannonse`. Matching on
 * equality would attribute almost nothing, and attributing almost nothing is the way this
 * whole plan quietly fails — models built, control shipped, no addresses in the content.
 *
 * Deliberately not a stemmer. A stemmer for Norwegian is a dependency, a language setting and
 * a source of confident wrong answers; what is wanted here is a **suggester** whose output an
 * author confirms. So: the dictionary word must be a prefix of the surface form, and what is
 * left over must be a short ending the language actually uses.
 *
 * The asymmetry is on purpose. `hus → huset` is a form of the word; `huset → hus` would also
 * be, but the dictionary side is the one written by a human and is already the base form.
 */

/**
 * Endings that turn a base form into a surface one: the noun paradigm (-en/-et/-a/-er/-ene),
 * the verb one (-r/-te/-t/-de/-d/-et), the adjective one (-e/-t). Longer than three letters
 * is not inflection, it is a different word.

/**
 * Below this, the ending is a bigger share of the word than the word is: `si` and `sin` are
 * different words, and so are `by` and `byer`. Suggesting either would teach an author to
 * stop reading the suggestions.
 *
 * Three, not four — `hus → huset` is the commonest noun in the material and a four-letter
 * floor throws it away. The cost is that some three-letter pairs will be offered wrongly,
 * and an author declining a suggestion is cheaper than a word nobody can attribute.
