/**
 * The addressable pieces of an exercise — plan 63, phase 1.
 *
 * An exercise is a page; the thing a learner is actually right or wrong about is smaller
 * than that, and it is the smaller thing an atom is attached to. This module answers one
 * question for every template: **what can be pointed at inside this document, and what is
 * each piece called.**
 *
 * The names are not invented here. They are whatever the template already calls its pieces
 * in the results it publishes — `sentenceId#tokenIndex` for a gap, the pair id for a pair —
 * because a target keyed differently from the evidence could never be joined to it. Adding
 * a template means adding one function below, not agreeing a format.
 */

   * on the right, and a suggester looking only at the left half of those finds nothing at
   * all. Matching both is not a guess — the pair as a whole is about the word, whichever
   * side it was typed on.
