// What a student is allowed to receive, and what comes back with the verdict.
//
// README, Security: "grading must also run server-side. `chunk.field`, `chunk.alt`,
// `row.fb` and `row.why` are the answer key — strip them from the student payload and
// return marks from `POST /attempts`." Plan 52 §3.2 adds `row.text` to that list: it is
// the word order written out, and the runner never renders it.
//
// The `content` column already excludes all of it (persistence.ts), so this module is not
// the only line of defence — it is the one that also *arranges* what is left: the bank is
// assembled and shuffled here, server-side, because a bank in sentence order would hand
// over the answer just as surely as the key would.
//
// One projection rule that looks like an omission and is not: an undeliverable row is
// dropped rather than sent half-built. A row with an unplaced chunk cannot be graded, and
// a student cannot be asked to solve a sentence whose key does not exist yet.
