// Model for the `sentence_schema` exercise — the topological-field board.
//
// Source of truth: docs/design/activity-specs/design_handoff_sentence_schema/README.md
// in ssz-platform-web, as amended by the decisions in docs/plan/52-sentence-schema.md.
//
// The governing idea: **the field set is data, not behaviour.** Nothing here knows about
// Norwegian. A schema is an ordered list of named fields per clause type, seeded from a
// language pack (presets.ts) and freely editable per exercise — so the same runtime
// serves the Norwegian setningsskjema, the German Feldermodell, or three unnamed boxes.
//
// The second rule, from IMPLEMENTATION.md: **never store the key twice.** `row.chunks` is
// the answer key *and* the source of the word bank. There is no separate answer array,
// so there is nothing that can drift out of sync with it.

/**
 * The clause types a schema can describe.
 *
 * Fixed, not data: five is what the handoff draws, the builder shows one toggle chip per
 * type, and every pack supplies a field list for each. A sixth would be a new chip and a
 * new column in every pack — a change to the type, not to content.
