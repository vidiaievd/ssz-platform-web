// Which explanation a wrong placement earns — the handoff's `ssFbFor`.
//
// Resolution order, from README: `row.fb[chunkId]` → a default for the kind of mistake →
// `row.why`. From attempt 2, `settings.hintAfterMistake` appends `row.why` underneath.
//
// The kernel returns a **source and a code**, never a sentence. The handoff writes the
// defaults as English prose ("Right field, wrong order inside it."); the platform renders
// student copy in four languages, so prose in shared logic could not be shown to anyone
// (plan 52 §5, the same rule as short_answer and writing_task).
//
// Why the fallback chain ends at `row.why` rather than at silence: the rule is written
// once and does three jobs — it is shown on success, it is the last-resort explanation
// here, and it is the escalating hint. That is why `why` is a blocker in issues.ts and
// why its copy has to explain the structure rather than praise the student.
