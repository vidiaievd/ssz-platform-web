// Turning a sentence into chunks, and keeping the author's placements while they edit it.

// Source: `ssTokenize` / `ssRetokenize` and the join/split buttons of the handoff's
// chunk strip (data.jsx, steps.jsx).
//
// There is no tokenizer here beyond whitespace, and that is deliberate (README, "Open /
// deferred"): no POS tagging, no parser. The teacher declares the key by hand because the
// key is also the teaching claim — a machine guess would quietly become the claim instead.

 * Recompute the chunks of a row after its text changed, carrying placements over.
 *
 * This runs on every keystroke, and the rule it implements is the difference between a
 * usable builder and an infuriating one: a teacher fixes a typo after placing eight
 * chunks, and none of that work may be lost (IMPLEMENTATION.md, "Re-tokenizing must
 * preserve work").
 *
 * Matching is by text, first match wins, and each old placement is consumed once — so a
 * sentence with two `ikke` hands one placement to each, not the same one twice. Only
 * chunks that *were* placed are eligible to carry anything: an unplaced chunk has nothing
 * to preserve, and treating it as a candidate would let it shadow a placed twin.
 *
 * Multi-word chunks survive whole. A joined `"I morgen"` matches the token run
 * `["I", "morgen"]` and is re-emitted as one chunk with its field and alts intact —
 * without that, joining a chunk and then fixing a comma elsewhere would silently split it
 * back apart.
