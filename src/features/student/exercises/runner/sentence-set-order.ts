/**
 * Which sentence of a set comes next, once the learner is allowed to put one aside.
 *
 * The handoff has no answer here. Its runner walks the set in order and closes a sentence
 * only by solving it or by being shown it, so a learner who cannot see how a sentence goes
 * has exactly one way forward: read the answer. That is a bad trade — the sentence is
 * spent, scored nothing, and taught nothing, when all they needed was to come back to it
 * with the other four behind them.
 *
 * So a sentence can be deferred **once**. It goes to the back, the set carries on, and it
 * is offered again after the last one. The "once" is what keeps this finite: a learner who
 * defers it a second time is telling you they are done with it, and the set ends with that
 * sentence unsolved rather than cycling.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from both callers, because the runner and the builder's preview have
 * to walk a set the same way — and because the interesting part is the ordering, which is
 * a thing you can write down cases for.
